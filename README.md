### Project Title :
### Quantitative analysis of Stock Market
### Project Description:
#### Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the analysis. Gather historical stock market data, including prices, volumes, and other relevant financial indicators.Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and errors.The Open Price Time Series Visualization makes Tesla look like its always been much more valuable as a company than GM and Ford. But to really understand this we would need to look at the total market cap of the company, not just the stock price. Unfortunately our current data doesn't have that information of total units of stock present. But what we can do as a simple calcualtion to try to represent total money traded would be to multply the Volume column by the Open price. Remember that this still isn't the actual Market Cap, its just a visual representation of the total amount of money being traded around using the time series.(e.g. 100 units of stock at $10 each versus 100000 units of stock at $1 each)
#### 1.Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the analysis.
#### 2.Gather historical stock market data, including prices, volumes, and other relevant financial indicators.
#### 3.Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and errors.
#### 4.Conduct initial analysis to understand data distributions, patterns, and correlations.
#### 5.Implement various strategies based on quantitative analysis.

### Conclusion:
#### In this project, I am conducted a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the stock market using Python, focusing on the correlation between various stock prices and key economic indicators. Our findings revealed a significant relationship between interest rates and stock returns, suggesting that macroeconomic conditions heavily influence market performance. We utilized time series analysis and regression models, leveraging libraries such as Pandas and Statsmodels for data manipulation and statistical modeling.
